# Google Trends Test

## Getting started

I did some research about writing JS Page Object Model automated tests and found this project. I cloned the repo from https://github.com/QAUnderground/JavaScript_Mocha_Selenium and updated the scructure to make it clearer to understand. 

The test directory contains the test class and the page object classes are found under the pageobjects dir.
